#Exercise 1: Grade Classification
#Write a program that asks the user for a grade (a number between 0 and 100) and prints the corresponding letter grade:

#90 or above â†’ "A"

#80 to 89 â†’ "B"

#70 to 79 â†’ "C"

#60 to 69 â†’ "D"

#Below 60 â†’ "F"



grade = int(input("Enter your grade(0 to 100): "))

if grade < 0 or grade > 100:
    print("Invalid! Please enter a number between 0 and 100.")
else:
    if grade >= 90:
        print("A")
    elif grade >= 80:
        print("B")
    elif grade >= 70:
        print("C")
    elif grade >= 60:
        print("D")
    else:
        print("F")


#Exercise 2: Temperature Check
#Write a program that asks the user to input the current temperature in Celsius and prints:

#"It's freezing!" if the temperature is below 0Â°C.

#"It's cold!" if the temperature is between 0 and 15Â°C.

#"It's warm!" if the temperature is between 16 and 25Â°C.

#"It's hot!" if the temperature is above 25Â°C.

temp = int(input("Input Temperature: "))
if temp <= 0:
    print("it's freezing!")
elif temp <= 15:
    print("It's cold!")
elif temp <= 25:
    print("It's warm!")
else:
    print("It's Hot!")


#Exercise 3: Voting Eligibility
#Write a program that checks if a person is eligible to vote. The person is eligible if their age is 18 or above. The program should:

#Ask the user for their age.

#Print "You are eligible to vote." if the age is 18 or older.

#Print "You are not eligible to vote." if the age is under 18.

age = int(input("Enter age here: "))
if age < 18:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are eligible to vote!")



#Exercise 4: Even or Odd Number
#Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd.

#If the number is divisible by 2 (remainder is 0), print "The number is even."

#If the number is not divisible by 2 (remainder is not 0), print "The number is odd."

number = int(input("Insert number here: "))
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even")
else:
    print("Number is odd")


#Exercise 5: Month to Season
#Write a program that asks the user for the name of a month (e.g., "January", "March", "August") and prints the season:


#"Winter" for December, January, or February.

#"Spring" for March, April, or May.

#"Summer" for June, July, or August.

#"Fall" for September, October, or November.
user_months = input("Input month here: ")

winter_months = ["January", "February", "March"]
spring_months = ["April", "May", "June"]

elif user_months in summer_months:
    print("Summer")
elif user_months in fall_months:
    print("Fall")
else:
    print("That's not a valid month.")


#Exercise 6: Age Group Categorization
#Write a program that takes a user's age and determines their age group:

#"Child" if the age is between 0 and 12.

#"Teenager" if the age is between 13 and 17.

#"Adult" if the age is between 18 and 64.

#"Senior" if the age is 65 or older.

user_age = int(input("Input age here: "))
if user_age in range(0,12):
    print("Child")
elif user_age in range(13,17):
    print("Teenager")
elif user_age in range(18,46):
    print("Adult")
else:print("Senior")


#Exercise 7: Discount Eligibility
#Write a program that asks the user for the total amount of a purchase and prints a discount message:

#If the purchase is over $100, give a 20% discount.

#If the purchase is between $50 and $100 (inclusive), give a 10% discount.

#If the purchase is less than $50, give no discount.

total = float(input("Input total purchase amount: "))

if total >= 100:
    discount = 0.20
    print("You get 20% discount!")
elif 50 < total < 100:
    discount = 0.10
    print("You get 10% discount!")
else:
    discount = 0.0
    print("You get no discount!")

final_price = total - (total * discount)
print(f"Your final price is: ${final_price:.2f}")


#8.ðŸ§ª Exercise: Movie Ticket Price Calculator
#ask:

#Ask the user for their age and calculate the ticket price based on this rule set:


#Age Range	Ticket Price
#0â€“3 years	Free
#4â€“12 years	$8
#13â€“64 years	$12
#65 and above	$7
