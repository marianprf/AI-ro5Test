🧠 Marian | Psychologist Turned Aspiring AI Engineer
Greetings, fellow nerds 👋

I'm Marian, currently based in Vienna and on an exciting journey from understanding the human mind to building the machine mind. 🎓 I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, and I'm currently enrolled in an AI Engineering program at SD Academy, where I'm learning to translate curiosity into code.

I'm passionate about the intersection of cognitive science, machine learning, and all things tech. My GitHub is a growing archive of learning experiments, small victories, and the occasional beautifully-documented bug. 🐛

📚 Interests:

Neural networks (both biological & artificial 🧠🤖)

Python, Data Science, and ML pipelines

Turning coffee into algorithms ☕➡️💻

Open source collaboration & lifelong learning

💡 Let’s connect, collab, or debug together.
