Marian | AI Engineer in Training
Hi, I’m Marian, based in Vienna and currently enrolled in an AI Engineering program at SD Academy. I have a background in Psychology (B.A.), and I'm now transitioning into the tech world with a focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data-driven solutions.

I’m passionate about understanding how systems learn, adapt, and interact — whether human or machine. My GitHub is where I document my learning journey, share projects, and build practical skills in Python, AI, and beyond.
